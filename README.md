# SCT_ML_02
This project uses K-Means clustering to group mall customers into five distinct segments based on their annual income and spending score.  The goal is to identify different customer types—such as high-earners who spend a lot ("Prime Targets") versus those who are more frugal—to help the mall create more effective, targeted marketing campaigns.
